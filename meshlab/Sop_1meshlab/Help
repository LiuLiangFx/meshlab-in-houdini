= MeshLab =

""" Processes geometry through the [MeshLab|http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/] command line interface. """


@Parameters
Script:
    First Mesh:
        Will be used as first input geometry, if there is no input connected. Avoids geometry caching step, the node will cook faster. Geometry must be in one of interchangeable formats: ply, obj or stl.
    Second Mesh:
        Will be used as second input geometry, if there is no input connected. Avoids geometry caching step, the node will cook faster. Geometry must be in one of interchangeable formats: ply, obj or stl.
    Options:
        Which data will be saved in the MeshLab output files. For example, if script generates normals, "Vertex Normals" must be chosen, otherwise imported mesh will not contain it.
Settings:
    MeshLab Server:
        Path to meshlabserver executable.
    Temp Directory:
        Directory to save temporary files.
    Houdini to MeshLab:
        A file format which will be used to send geometry to the MeshLab.
    MeshLab to Houdini:
        A file format which will be used to get geometry back from the MeshLab.
    Uninstall Filters:
        Uninstall selected filters from the HDA filters library.
    Install Filters:
        Install filters from a file. If the filter already exists, user will be prompted to update default values.
